# User Guide

Welcome to the WhatsApp Home Boss user guide. This documentation helps you understand all features and capabilities of the household management system.

## What is WhatsApp Home Boss?

WhatsApp Home Boss is a household operating system that lives in your WhatsApp. It helps you:

- Track and complete household chores with peer verification
- Manage personal tasks with optional accountability partners
- Coordinate grocery shopping through shared lists
- View performance rankings and weekly reports
- Join new households and manage members

## How It Works

The system uses natural language - you just type messages like you normally would on WhatsApp. The AI understands your intent and performs the appropriate action.

**Example messages:**
- "Done dishes" - Log chore completion
- "Stats" - View your performance
- "Add milk to the list" - Add to shopping list
- "/personal add go to gym" - Create personal task

## Key Concepts

### Household Chores vs Personal Chores

WhatsApp Home Boss manages two separate systems:

**Household Chores**
- Shared responsibilities tracked on the leaderboard
- Visible to all household members
- Require verification from other members
- Commands: "Done [chore]", "Create chore", "Stats"

**Personal Chores**
- Private individual tasks (only you can see)
- Optional accountability partner for verification
- NOT included in household leaderboard
- Commands: `/personal add`, `/personal done`, `/personal stats`

### Verification System

To ensure accountability, household chores require peer verification:

1. You log a chore completion
2. Another household member reviews and approves
3. Once approved, the chore is marked complete and you earn points

Personal chores can be self-verified or verified by an accountability partner you choose.

### Weekly Leaderboard

Every Sunday evening, you'll receive an automated report showing:
- Top 3 performers for the week
- Your personal ranking and stats
- Total household chore count
- Most neglected chore
