### US-009: Remove/update deployment files
Status: in_progress
Depends on: None

Description:
As a developer, I want to remove PocketBase-related deployment files to simplify the project.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Remove Dockerfile.pocketbase if it exists
- [ ] Simplify docker-compose.yml to just WAHA
- [ ] Remove railway.toml and railway.pocketbase.toml if they exist
- [ ] Update Taskfile.yml to remove PocketBase tasks
- [ ] Update .github/workflows/ci.yml to remove PocketBase installation step
- [ ] Example: docker-compose up starts only WAHA container
- [ ] Negative case: no dangling references to PocketBase in any config files
