### US-009: Migrate AGENTS.md to Contributors section
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-005

Description:
As a contributor, I want AGENTS.md content integrated into MkDocs so all contributor docs are unified.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Extract content from AGENTS.md into appropriate MkDocs pages
- [ ] Maintain all coding standards and conventions
- [ ] Update AGENTS.md to reference the MkDocs documentation
- [ ] Ensure no critical information is lost in migration
- [ ] Example: 'Toolchain & Style' section goes to docs/contributors/toolchain.md
- [ ] Negative case: Missing convention in MkDocs -> compare against AGENTS.md to ensure completeness
- [ ] Verify internal consistency across all pages
