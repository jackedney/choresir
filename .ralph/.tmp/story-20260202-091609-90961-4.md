### US-008: Use match statements for complex conditional chains
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-003

Description:
As a developer, I want to use Python 3.10+ match statements to replace complex if-elif chains for better readability.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Convert _get_dynamic_title() (scheduler.py:207-215) to use match statement
- [ ] Identify other if-elif chains with 4+ branches that could benefit from match
- [ ] Example: `match (rank, completions): case (1, c) if c >= THRESHOLD: return 'Carrying the team!'`
- [ ] Negative case: Keep simple if-else for 2-3 conditions where match adds verbosity
- [ ] All tests pass
