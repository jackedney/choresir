### US-010: Narrow broad exception handlers to specific types
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-005

Description:
As a developer, I want specific exception types caught instead of broad Exception so that errors are properly categorized and debuggable.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Audit all 21 `except Exception` handlers
- [ ] Replace with specific exceptions where the error type is known (e.g., httpx.HTTPError, pydantic.ValidationError)
- [ ] Keep broad Exception only at top-level error boundaries with proper logging
- [ ] Example: `except httpx.TimeoutException: ...` instead of `except Exception:`
- [ ] Negative case: Top-level FastAPI exception handlers may legitimately catch Exception
- [ ] All tests pass
