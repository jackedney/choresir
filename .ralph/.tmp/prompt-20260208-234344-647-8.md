# Build

You are an autonomous coding agent. Your task is to complete the work for exactly one story and record the outcome.

- uv run pytest tests/integration/

## Selected Story (Do not change scope)
ID: US-008
Title: Update conftest.py for SQLite testing

Story details:
### US-008: Update conftest.py for SQLite testing
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-001, US-002

Description:
As a developer, I want to update test fixtures to use SQLite instead of PocketBase.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Remove PocketBase server fixture from tests/conftest.py
- [ ] Use temp SQLite file for test isolation
- [ ] Replace MockDBClient with real db_client using test DB
- [ ] Tests run without PocketBase server
- [ ] Example: pytest tests/unit/ runs successfully with temp database
- [ ] Negative case: test database is cleaned up after test session


If the story details are empty or missing, STOP and report that the PRD story format could not be parsed.

## Rules (Non-Negotiable)
- Implement **only** the work required to complete the selected story.
- Complete all tasks associated with this story (and only this story).
- Do NOT ask the user questions.
- Do NOT change unrelated code.
- Do NOT assume something is unimplemented — confirm by reading code.
- Implement completely; no placeholders or stubs.
- If No-commit is true, do NOT commit or push changes.
- Do NOT edit the PRD JSON (status is handled by the loop).
- All changes made during the run must be committed (including updates to progress/logs).
 - Before committing, perform a final **security**, **performance**, and **regression** review of your changes.

## Your Task (Do this in order)
1. Read /Users/jackedney/conductor/repos/whatsapp-home-boss/.ralph/guardrails.md before any code changes.
2. Read /Users/jackedney/conductor/repos/whatsapp-home-boss/.ralph/errors.log for repeated failures to avoid.
3. Read /Users/jackedney/conductor/repos/whatsapp-home-boss/.agents/tasks/prd-sqlite-migration.json for global context (do not edit).
4. Fully audit and read all necessary files to understand the task end-to-end before implementing. Do not assume missing functionality.
5. If /Users/jackedney/conductor/repos/whatsapp-home-boss/AGENTS.md exists, follow its build/test instructions.
6. Implement only the tasks that belong to US-008.
7. Run verification commands listed in the story, the global quality gates, and in /Users/jackedney/conductor/repos/whatsapp-home-boss/AGENTS.md (if required).
8. If the project has a build or dev workflow, run what applies:
   - Build step (e.g., `npm run build`) if defined.
   - Dev server (e.g., `npm run dev`, `wrangler dev`) if it is the normal validation path.
   - Confirm no runtime/build errors in the console.
9. Perform a brief audit before committing:
   - **Security:** check for obvious vulnerabilities or unsafe handling introduced by your changes.
   - **Performance:** check for avoidable regressions (extra queries, heavy loops, unnecessary re-renders).
   - **Regression:** verify existing behavior that could be impacted still works.
10. If No-commit is false, commit changes using the `$commit` skill.
    - Stage everything: `git add -A`
    - Confirm a clean working tree after commit: `git status --porcelain` should be empty.
    - After committing, capture the commit hash and subject using:
      `git show -s --format="%h %s" HEAD`.
11. Append a progress entry to /Users/jackedney/conductor/repos/whatsapp-home-boss/.ralph/progress.md with run/commit/test details (format below).
    If No-commit is true, skip committing and note it in the progress entry.

```

## Completion Signal
Only output the completion signal when the **selected story** is fully complete and verified.
When the selected story is complete, output:
<promise>COMPLETE</promise>

Otherwise, end normally without the signal.

## Additional Guardrails
- When authoring documentation, capture the why (tests + implementation intent).
- If you learn how to run/build/test the project, update /Users/jackedney/conductor/repos/whatsapp-home-boss/AGENTS.md briefly (operational only).
- Keep AGENTS operational only; progress notes belong in /Users/jackedney/conductor/repos/whatsapp-home-boss/.ralph/progress.md.
- If you hit repeated errors, log them in /Users/jackedney/conductor/repos/whatsapp-home-boss/.ralph/errors.log and add a Sign to /Users/jackedney/conductor/repos/whatsapp-home-boss/.ralph/guardrails.md using /opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules/@iannuttall/ralph/.agents/ralph/references/GUARDRAILS.md as the template.

## Activity Logging (Required)
Log major actions to /Users/jackedney/conductor/repos/whatsapp-home-boss/.ralph/activity.log using the helper:
```
/Users/jackedney/conductor/repos/whatsapp-home-boss/ralph log "message"
```
Log at least:
- Start of work on the story
- After major code changes
- After tests/verification
- After updating progress log

## Browser Testing (Required for Frontend Stories)
If the selected story changes UI, you MUST verify it in the browser:
1. Load the `dev-browser` skill.
2. Navigate to the relevant page.
3. Verify the UI changes work as expected.
4. Take a screenshot if helpful for the progress log.

A frontend story is NOT complete until browser verification passes.
