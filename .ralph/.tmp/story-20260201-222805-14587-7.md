### US-007: Replace magic numbers and strings with constants
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-001

Description:
As a developer, I want magic values extracted to named constants so that code is self-documenting and changes are centralized.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Extract magic numbers: chunk_size=50 (analytics), max_connections=10 (redis), maxlen=100 (tracker)
- [ ] Add constants to appropriate config or constants module
- [ ] Example: `ANALYTICS_CHUNK_SIZE = 50` in config, used as `chunk_size=config.ANALYTICS_CHUNK_SIZE`
- [ ] Negative case: Keep inline values for truly one-off or self-explanatory cases (e.g., `range(3)` for retries already named)
- [ ] All tests pass
