### US-003: Implement PocketBase filter query parser
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-001

Description:
As a developer, I want to parse PocketBase-style filter queries into SQL WHERE clauses so that existing filter code continues to work.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Create parse_filter(filter_query: str) -> tuple[str, list[Any]] function
- [ ] Use regex to tokenize filter strings
- [ ] Convert operators: = stays, ~ becomes LIKE, && becomes AND, || becomes OR
- [ ] Support >= and < comparison operators
- [ ] Handle parentheses for grouping
- [ ] Extract values and return parameterized SQL with bind values
- [ ] Example: parse_filter('name = "test" && active = true') returns ('name = ? AND active = ?', ['test', 1])
- [ ] Negative case: malformed filter string raises ParseError with helpful message
