### US-005: Add bounded cache to format_phone_for_waha
Status: in_progress
Depends on: None

Description:
As a developer, I want the phone formatter to use bounded caching to prevent unbounded memory growth.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Replace @functools.cache with @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=1024) on format_phone_for_waha in src/interface/whatsapp_sender.py:72
- [ ] Cache still provides same functionality with bounded size
- [ ] Example: first 1024 unique phone numbers are cached, 1025th evicts oldest
- [ ] All type hints pass ty check
