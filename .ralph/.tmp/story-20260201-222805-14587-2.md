### US-002: Consolidate error classification duplication in errors.py
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-001

Description:
As a developer, I want to eliminate the ~70 lines of duplicated error phrase matching between classify_agent_error() and classify_error_with_response() so that error classification logic is maintainable.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Extract shared ERROR_PATTERNS dict with categories: quota, rate_limit, auth, network, validation, context_length
- [ ] Create single internal _match_error_pattern() function used by both public functions
- [ ] Reduce total lines in errors.py by at least 50 lines
- [ ] Example: Adding a new error pattern only requires updating ERROR_PATTERNS dict
- [ ] Negative case: Ensure both functions still return their different result types correctly
- [ ] All existing tests for error classification pass
