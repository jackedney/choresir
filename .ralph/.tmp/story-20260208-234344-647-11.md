### US-011: Update README.md with new setup instructions
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-010

Description:
As a user, I want updated documentation so that I can set up the app without PocketBase or Redis.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Update setup instructions to reflect simplified setup without PocketBase or Redis
- [ ] Document sqlite_db_path configuration option
- [ ] Remove references to external database servers
- [ ] Example: README shows correct steps to start app with just WAHA
- [ ] Negative case: no mentions of PocketBase remain in README
