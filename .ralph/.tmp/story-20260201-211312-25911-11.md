### US-011: Update existing tests for new changes
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-003, US-004, US-005, US-010

Description:
As a developer, I want all existing tests updated to work with the new code changes so that the test suite passes.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Update tests/unit/test_webhook.py to mock HMAC validation or provide valid headers
- [ ] Update tests/unit/test_whatsapp_parser.py to include timestamp in all test payloads
- [ ] Update any integration tests that send webhook payloads to include valid HMAC headers
- [ ] Ensure all mocked settings include waha_webhook_hmac_key
- [ ] Example: pytest runs with all tests passing
- [ ] Negative case: No test failures related to missing HMAC or timestamp
