### US-003: Narrow exception catch in webhook admin notifications
Status: in_progress
Depends on: None

Description:
As a developer, I want exception handling to be specific to avoid masking unexpected errors.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Replace broad 'except Exception' with specific exceptions (RuntimeError, ConnectionError, OSError) in src/interface/webhook.py:462
- [ ] Example: KeyError still raises and is logged
- [ ] Negative case: unexpected exceptions are not silently caught
- [ ] All type hints pass ty check
