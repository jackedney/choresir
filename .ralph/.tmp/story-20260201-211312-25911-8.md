### US-008: Remove PII from remaining service logs
Status: in_progress
Depends on: None

Description:
As a security-conscious developer, I want phone numbers removed from all remaining service modules so that PII is not exposed anywhere.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Update src/services/personal_chore_service.py line 153 - remove owner_phone from log
- [ ] Update src/services/user_service.py lines 48, 66, 88, 140 - remove phone from logs
- [ ] Update src/core/scheduler.py line 479 - remove owner_phone from log
- [ ] Update src/services/session_service.py lines 52, 71, 103, 129, 137, 167, 210 - remove phone from logs
- [ ] Update src/services/personal_verification_service.py lines 91, 164 - remove phone from logs
- [ ] Update src/agents/choresir_agent.py lines 317, 323, 497, 517 - remove user_phone from logs
- [ ] Use structured extra={'operation': '...'} pattern consistently
- [ ] Example: All service logs use structured metadata without PII
- [ ] Negative case: grep -r 'phone' src/ --include='*.py' | grep logger shows no phone variable logging
