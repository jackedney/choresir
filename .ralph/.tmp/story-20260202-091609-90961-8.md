### US-012: Final cleanup pass with ruff and remove commented code
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-011

Description:
As a developer, I want a final automated cleanup pass to catch any remaining issues and remove all commented-out code blocks.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Run `uv run ruff check --fix src tests` to auto-fix remaining issues
- [ ] Run `uv run ruff format src tests` to ensure consistent formatting
- [ ] Manually review and remove any commented-out code blocks (ERA rule)
- [ ] Example: Remove `# old_function()` or `# TODO: delete this` dead code
- [ ] Negative case: Keep legitimate TODO comments that reference future work with issue numbers
- [ ] All quality gates pass: ruff check, ruff format, pytest
