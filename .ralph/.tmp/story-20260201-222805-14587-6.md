### US-006: Extract database update pattern to reusable utility
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-002

Description:
As a developer, I want a reusable pattern for get-then-update database operations so that this 65+ occurrence pattern is DRY.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Create db_client utility method: update_first_matching(collection, filter_query, update_data) -> bool
- [ ] Replace repeated get_first_record + update_record patterns with the new utility
- [ ] Start with webhook.py which has multiple instances of this pattern
- [ ] Example: `await db_client.update_first_matching('messages', f'waha_id="{msg_id}"', {'status': 'delivered'})`
- [ ] Negative case: Keep separate calls when additional logic exists between get and update
- [ ] All tests pass
