### US-006: Create Architecture documentation
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-002

Description:
As a contributor, I want architecture documentation so I understand system design and patterns.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Document overall system architecture and components
- [ ] Document directory structure and purpose of each directory
- [ ] Document engineering patterns (functional services, DTOs, dependency injection)
- [ ] Document database interaction patterns (PocketBase via DatabaseService)
- [ ] Document async and concurrency patterns
- [ ] Example: src/services/ contains functional business logic, not service classes
- [ ] Negative case: Direct PocketBase import -> document correct pattern via DatabaseService
- [ ] Include diagrams using text-based format (ASCII or Mermaid if supported)
