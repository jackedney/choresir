Description:
As a developer, I want to verify all tests pass and the app works correctly after the migration.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Run pytest tests/unit/ - all tests pass
- [ ] Run pytest tests/integration/ - all tests pass
- [ ] Run uv run ruff check && uv run ruff format --check - linting passes
- [ ] Start app with uv run uvicorn src.main:app - app starts successfully
- [ ] /health endpoint returns healthy
- [ ] SQLite file created at configured path
- [ ] Example: full test suite completes with 0 failures
- [ ] Negative case: any test failures are fixed before marking complete
