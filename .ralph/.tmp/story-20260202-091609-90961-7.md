### US-011: Remove unused dependencies from pyproject.toml
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-010

Description:
As a developer, I want only necessary dependencies in pyproject.toml so that the project has minimal attack surface and faster installs.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Audit all dependencies in pyproject.toml against actual imports in src/
- [ ] Remove any dependencies not imported anywhere
- [ ] Verify optional dev dependencies are all used in tests/ or tooling
- [ ] Example: If `croniter` is imported, keep it; if not, remove it
- [ ] Negative case: Keep transitive dependencies that are required by direct deps
- [ ] All tests pass with the reduced dependency set
