### US-005: Create Contributors documentation
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-002

Description:
As a contributor, I want development documentation so I can understand how to work on the codebase.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Document development workflow (setup, run, test, build)
- [ ] Document code quality commands (ruff format, ruff check, ty check, pytest)
- [ ] Document contribution guidelines (commit standards, PR process)
- [ ] Document local development environment setup
- [ ] Example: Pre-commit checklist with all required commands
- [ ] Negative case: Skipping quality gates causes CI failure -> document required checks
- [ ] Align with AGENTS.md instructions
