### US-005: Update config.py for SQLite
Status: in_progress
Depends on: None

Description:
As a developer, I want to update configuration settings to use SQLite instead of PocketBase.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Remove PocketBase URL and credentials settings from src/core/config.py
- [ ] Add sqlite_db_path setting with default ./data/choresir.db
- [ ] Keep Redis URL as optional for backwards compatibility
- [ ] Example: Config loads successfully with only sqlite_db_path set
- [ ] Negative case: missing required environment variables still raise validation errors
