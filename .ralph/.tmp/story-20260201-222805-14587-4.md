### US-004: Introduce functools.cache and functools.partial where beneficial
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-001

Description:
As a developer, I want to use functools caching and partial application to simplify repetitive code patterns.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Identify pure functions that could benefit from @functools.cache or @functools.lru_cache
- [ ] Replace lambda wrappers with functools.partial where applicable
- [ ] Example: Caching emoji lookups in _get_rank_emoji() if called repeatedly
- [ ] Negative case: Do not cache functions with side effects or mutable arguments
- [ ] All tests pass after changes
