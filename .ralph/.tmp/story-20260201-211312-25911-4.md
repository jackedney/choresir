### US-004: Handle missing timestamp in parser
Status: in_progress
Depends on: None

Description:
As a developer, I want the webhook parser to raise an explicit error when timestamp is missing so that invalid webhooks are rejected clearly.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Modify parse_waha_webhook() in src/interface/whatsapp_parser.py to check if timestamp is missing or empty
- [ ] If payload.get('timestamp') is None or empty string, raise ValueError('Missing required timestamp in webhook payload')
- [ ] This causes webhook to be rejected with 400 Bad Request (caught by exception handler)
- [ ] Example: Payload with timestamp=1678900000 parses successfully
- [ ] Negative case: Payload with no timestamp field raises ValueError
- [ ] Negative case: Payload with timestamp='' raises ValueError
- [ ] Update tests/unit/test_whatsapp_parser.py with test cases for missing timestamp
