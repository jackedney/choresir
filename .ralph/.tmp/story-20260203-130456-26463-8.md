### US-008: Migrate ADRs to MkDocs format
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-002

Description:
As a contributor, I want ADRs in MkDocs so all documentation is in one place.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Migrate existing ADRs from docs/decisions/ to docs/adr/
- [ ] Convert ADRs to MkDocs Markdown format
- [ ] Create ADR index page with chronological list
- [ ] Maintain ADR numbering and structure
- [ ] Example: ADR-017 on type checking becomes docs/adr/017-type-safety.md
- [ ] Negative case: Broken internal link after migration -> verify all links work
- [ ] Include ADR template for new decisions
