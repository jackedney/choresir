### US-008: Update conftest.py for SQLite testing
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-001, US-002

Description:
As a developer, I want to update test fixtures to use SQLite instead of PocketBase.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Remove PocketBase server fixture from tests/conftest.py
- [ ] Use temp SQLite file for test isolation
- [ ] Replace MockDBClient with real db_client using test DB
- [ ] Tests run without PocketBase server
- [ ] Example: pytest tests/unit/ runs successfully with temp database
- [ ] Negative case: test database is cleaned up after test session
