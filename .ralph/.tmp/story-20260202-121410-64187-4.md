### US-004: Add structured logging to rate_limiter.py exception handler
Status: in_progress
Depends on: None

Description:
As a developer, I want the rate limiter exception handler to use structured logging so that debugging is easier.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Update logger.exception at line 97 to include extra={'scope': scope, 'limit': limit, 'window_seconds': window_seconds}
- [ ] Keep exc_info preserved for stack trace
- [ ] Example: Rate limit error logs with scope, limit, and window_seconds in extra
- [ ] Negative case: Do not include user identifiers, phone numbers, or emails in extra
